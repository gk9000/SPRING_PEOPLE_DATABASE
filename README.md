This is another project that is presented in Terry Martin's "Professional Java Developer Career Starter: Java Foundations" course on Udemy.

The project is a web application for performing CRUD operations on people objects. Application has 3 layers: web layer (controllers and formatters), business logics layer (model and service) and database connection layer (repositories). People may (but not must) have images (jpg files) assosiated with them. Application also can import a CSV file, create objects based on data from that file and store them in a database. Web interface can be presented in another language if URL is updated manually ("?locale=...." is added). As this is a study project, an embedded database (H2) is used.

Technologies used: Java, Spring, Spring Data, Bootstrap, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, basic HTML.

Of course, the project was done by the teacher. The fact that this project is presented here doesn't mean that I myself currently can create something like this. It only means that I kind of understand what is going on there :-).
